# PuzzleSim Demo Data
This repository contains the data necessary to run the [demo](https://github.com/nihermann/PuzzleSim/blob/main/demo.ipynb) from the [PuzzleSim repository](https://github.com/nihermann/PuzzleSim). For more information about the PuzzleSim metric, please refer to the [project page](https://nihermann.github.io/puzzlesim/index.html) or the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489).

## Data
The sample data was selected from common benchmark datasets for neural rendering. The samples in each `priors` directory are taken from the [Mip-NeRF 360](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/) outdoor and the [Deep Blending](http://visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pubs/deepblending/) scenes.
How we obtained the test images is described in our paper [Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided No-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489).
